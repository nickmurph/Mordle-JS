running a local server via python
1. open terminal with python installed
2. cd to the project directory (eg, pwd, cd .., cd Mordle-JS)
3. use the following command: python -m http.server 
4. navigate to localhost:8000 in the browser 
5. if a file directory loads instead of the page, simply click your html


Better alternates:
live-server, run command at root of project or where index.html is located
npm start

*both of the above are live updating servers, so no onerous refreshing of page with each minor change
