# Mordle-JS
A Wordle-like browser game, spiritually adapted from the ![previous Mordle project](https://github.com/nickmurph/Mordle), a Python/Pygame desktop app.

## Features
- Like Wordle, the user has 6 attempts to guess a 5 letter word.
- Color-coding tracks entered letters across three categories: correct, valid, incorrect.
- Unlike Wordle, the user may play as many rounds as they like; the game state is reverted after every round and a new word is generated.
- Unlimited rounds offer the chance to quickly improve at starting word selection and guess-making.  
- Written in vanilla JS.
